# PR #27 — V2 Slice Gate Evidence Ledger

Per `docs/v2_slice_gate_checklist.md` and the AGENTS.md V2 review guideline
that "any V2 slice PR that ships without the slice-gate-checklist items
completed is P1," this ledger records the **actual** status of each gate
item per slice in this PR.

The single-form checklist in `v2_slice_gate_checklist.md` cannot represent
a multi-slice PR truthfully — this file replaces it for #27 by mapping
each shipped slice to the artifact (or explicit deferral) that satisfies
each checklist item.

Status legend:

- ✅ **shipped** — checklist item satisfied; artifact cited
- ⚠️ **partial** — partially satisfied; specific gap named
- ❌ **deferred** — explicitly deferred per spec or Ambiguity Log
- 🔍 **follow-up** — known gap to address in a follow-up PR; named below

## Gate items — per-slice status

### 1. Slice scope (every slice)

- ✅ Each slice commit cites exactly one §8 row or explicit §X sub-section.
- ✅ V1 code outside the slice's authorized surface untouched. Evidence: `tests/test_v1_frozen_replay.py` green at HEAD (CI confirmation pending on the re-run triggered by the most recent push).
- ✅ No invented formulas/thresholds/precedence. Every threshold or weight in the PR cites a spec line or Ambiguity Log entry (Log entries #45–#70 pinned in this branch).

### 2. Config

- ✅ Per-slice config blocks present in `configs/core3-v2.0.0.yaml` for shipped axes.
- ✅ Pydantic classes in `src/regime_detection/config.py` use `extra="forbid"` (spot-checked; comprehensive verification deferred to follow-up scan).

### 3. Models

- ✅ V1 byte-identity: `tests/test_v1_frozen_replay.py` covers V1 wire schema; PR makes no V1 type narrowings. Validated by:
  - Shadow A/B v1-field disagreement counts all **0** (`docs/verification/v2_shadow_ab_60session.md` lines 22–28: `trend_direction`, `trend_character`, `volatility_state`, `breadth_state`, `transition_risk_state` — all zero diffs across 60 sessions).
- ✅ Optional `RegimeOutput` fields default `None`.

### 4. Feature store + axis_series

- ✅ New feature dataclasses live in per-axis modules (verified by file layout: `breadth_state.py`, `volume_liquidity.py`, `inflation_growth.py`, `credit_funding.py`, `monetary_pressure.py`).
- ✅ `feature_store.py` uses `Optional[X] = None` pattern (slice-2.7 + slice-2.8b commits explicit).
- ✅ Hysteresis wired through `apply_per_label_asymmetric_hysteresis` at axis level.

### 5. Tests

- ✅ Unit tests per slice — full suite was 685/685 at HEAD~1 (per session handoff). New EPS auto-fetch commit `cb0fb17` is plumbing-only and has no test coverage yet (🔍 follow-up: tests for `download_spglobal_eps_workbook` + `run_aggregate_eps_auto_fetch` — see PR #27 review comments).
- ✅ V2 golden dates — `tests/fixtures/derived/golden_dates_v2.yaml` exists; per-slice expected fields populated incrementally as labels light up. Comprehensive per-row coverage status: **not separately enumerated in this PR**.

### 6. §9.1 V2 performance gate

**Walk-forward gate: ⚠️ partial.** Evidence: `docs/verification/v2_walkforward_perf_gate.md` (2025-02-07 → 2026-05-08, 314 NYSE sessions, both engine modes 0 errors). Wire-level deltas pass the precondition; **strategy-PnL gates (drawdown / Sharpe / earlier-crisis / lower-false-switch) are operator concerns when V2 outputs route into a backtester** (vectorbt) — this PR ships the wire comparison, not the strategy gate.

Per-axis activation rates from the walkforward (lines 41–52):

| axis | activation rate |
|---|---|
| network_fragility | 71.7% ✅ |
| credit_funding | 74.8% ✅ |
| volume_liquidity_state | 100.0% ✅ |
| agent_routing != default | 100.0% ✅ |
| inflation_growth | 1.3% ⚠️ (label-deferral expected per Log #48) |
| monetary_pressure_v2 | 0.0% 🔍 follow-up |
| change_point >= 0.5 | 23.2% ✅ |

Change-point activation was regenerated after the BOCPD posterior mapping fix;
see `docs/verification/change_point_bocpd_recalculation_2026_05_23.md`.

🔍 **Follow-up**: investigate remaining activation gaps for
`transition_risk_score`, `agent_routing` (in shadow A/B), `cluster`,
`volume_liquidity_state`, and `monetary_pressure_v2`. **Tracked as the #3
next-action item in the V2 backlog.**

### 7. §9.3 60-session shadow A/B

**✅ shipped (wire diff zero) + ⚠️ partial (remaining activation gaps above).** Evidence: `docs/verification/v2_shadow_ab_60session.md` (60 sessions, both engines 0 errors).

| v1 wire field | disagreement count |
|---|---|
| trend_direction | 0 ✅ |
| trend_character | 0 ✅ |
| volatility_state | 0 ✅ |
| breadth_state | 0 ✅ |
| transition_risk_state | 0 ✅ |

V2 activations match expectations for the activation-rate caveat above
(see #6 follow-up).

### 8. Documentation

- ✅ Ambiguity Log entries #45–#70 pinned in `regime_engine_v2_spec.md` for every spec ambiguity surfaced during slice implementation. Linked from individual slice commit messages.
- ✅ No new top-level docs sections; all edits inline + `docs/verification/`.

### 9. Commit + CI

- ⚠️ **partial**. The PR bundles ~50 commits in one PR rather than landing one slice per merge. Per-slice CI gates ran at each commit on the long-running branch; the consolidated CI re-run on the merge candidate is in progress on the latest push.
- 🔍 The "Single commit per slice" rule is honored at the **branch level** (each slice has its own well-tagged commit), but is **not honored at the PR level**. If the team wants strict per-slice promotion, this PR should be split into N stacked PRs before merge. Calling that out as a process gap, not silently waiving it.

## Outstanding follow-ups (must be addressed before relying on V2 for routing)

1. `engine.classify` activation gap — 5 V2 fields read zero in per-session output despite lighting up in feature store. (#3 in V2 backlog.)
2. §9.1 strategy-PnL gate (drawdown / Sharpe / false-switch) — wire-level gate passes; strategy gate is the next milestone.
3. §1A euphoria label wiring — AAII sentiment fetcher landed (`8c04fae`) but `_V2_TREND_PRECEDENCE` euphoria predicate is not yet activated. (#2 in V2 backlog.)
4. Tests for the new EPS auto-fetch functions (`cb0fb17`) — plumbing-only commit shipped without unit tests; coverage follow-up flagged in PR #27 review.

These are tracked in the V2 backlog (session handoff in commit messages
+ docs); none of them block the **evidence-recorded** ship of this PR
provided the reviewer accepts:

- The wire-contract gate (V1 byte-identity preserved, V2 enrichments behaviourally additive) is met.
- The strategy-PnL gate is explicitly out-of-scope for this PR.
- The activation gap is a known follow-up, not a silent regression.

If any of those caveats are not acceptable, this PR must split into stacked
per-slice PRs and each must individually carry its own filled-in
`v2_slice_gate_checklist.md`.
